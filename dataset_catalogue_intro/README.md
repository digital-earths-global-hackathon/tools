## A gentle introduction to the HK25 data catalogue

Now that the global HK25 data catalogue exists, it is possible to start learning how to make effective use use it.
This dataset discovery notebook, written by Mark Muetzfeld (University of Reading) shows how to interrogate the HK25 catalogue to find the data we want to plot, and then select variables to produce simple plots.

The next step is to modify the notebooks available under EasyGEMS in order to use the HK-25 catalogue instead of the original NextGEMS/EERIE catalogues.
